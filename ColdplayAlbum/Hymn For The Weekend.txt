Drink from me, drink from me (I, oh, I, oh, I)
That I shoot across the symphony
That I shoot across the sky
Drink from me, drink from me (I, oh, I, oh, I)
That I shoot across the symphony
So high, so high
That I shoot across the sky

Oh, angel sent from up above
You know you make my world light up
When I was down, when I was hurt
You came to lift me up

Life is a drink and love’s a drug
Oh, now I think I must be miles up
When I was a river dried up
You came to rain a flood

You said: Drink from me, drink from me
When I was so thirsty
Poured on a symphony
Now I just can’t get enough
Put your wings on me, wings on me
When I was so heavy
Poured on a symphony
When I’m low, low, low, low

I, oh, I, oh, I
Got me feeling drunk and high
So high, so high
Oh, I, oh, I, oh, I
Now I’m feeling drunk and high
So high, so high

Oh, angel sent from up above
I feel you coursing through my blood
Life is a drink and your love’s about
To make the stars come out

Put your wings on me, wings on me
When I was so heavy
Poured on a symphony
When I’m low, low, low, low

I, oh I, oh I
You got me feeling drunk and high
So high, so high
Oh, I, oh, I, oh, I
Now I’m feeling drunk and high
So high, so high

I, oh, I, oh, I
La la la la la la la
So high, so high

I, oh, I, oh, I
Now I’m feeling drunk and high
So high, so high
That we shoot across the sky
That we shoot across the
That we shoot across the sky
That we shoot across the
That we shoot across the sky
That we shoot across the
That we shoot across the sky
That we shoot across the
